# Welt Studio Plugins Marketplace

A collection of Claude Code plugins for enhanced development experience.

## Available Plugins

| Plugin | Version | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `typescript-lsp` | 1.0.0 | TypeScript/JavaScript Language Server integration |
| `python-lsp` | 1.0.0 | Python Language Server integration (Pyright) |
| `spec-gate` | 0.3.0 | Spec-driven flow gated by the product owner: six named phases and six human decision gates |
| `comfy-local` | 0.2.0 | Drives a local ComfyUI over MCP: introspection, workflow building, execution, job and VRAM diagnostics, and output collection |
| `preflight` | 0.1.0 | Catches at write time what `/code-review` would catch later: blocks file edits through Bash inside any git repository, runs the repo pre-commit on each edit and at end of turn, flags leftovers of removed identifiers, and feeds the project's recurring findings into the system prompt |
| `game-art` | 0.2.0 | Generates game assets (sprite, icon, texture, background, UI, concept) with the Codex CLI image generator, cleans the background and saves them in the right folder of the Godot, Unity or Unreal project, with a `/game-art` panel to review and pick variants |

## Installation

One line per plugin, typed at the prompt of a terminal Claude Code session:

```
/plugin install typescript-lsp --marketplace welt-studio-desenvolvimentos-ltda/welt-studio-plugins
/plugin install python-lsp --marketplace welt-studio-desenvolvimentos-ltda/welt-studio-plugins
/plugin install spec-gate --marketplace welt-studio-desenvolvimentos-ltda/welt-studio-plugins
/plugin install comfy-local --marketplace welt-studio-desenvolvimentos-ltda/welt-studio-plugins
/plugin install preflight --marketplace welt-studio-desenvolvimentos-ltda/welt-studio-plugins
/plugin install game-art --marketplace welt-studio-desenvolvimentos-ltda/welt-studio-plugins
```

The first one asks to add the marketplace (`y`), then for a scope (Enter picks the user scope,
which applies to every session). From a local clone, pass its path instead:
`--marketplace /path/to/welt-studio-plugins`.

## Prerequisites

Only some plugins need anything installed. `spec-gate` and `preflight`
run on what Claude Code already provides.

### TypeScript LSP

```bash
npm install -g typescript-language-server typescript
```

### Python LSP

```bash
pip install pyright
# or
npm install -g pyright
```

### comfy-local

Requires `comfy-cli` in its own virtualenv and a ComfyUI workspace. The plugin installs
disabled on purpose, since it connects to an external service. See
[`plugins/comfy-local/README.md`](plugins/comfy-local/README.md).

### game-art

Requires the Codex CLI logged in (`codex login status`) and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).
Linux and WSL only. See [`plugins/game-art/README.md`](plugins/game-art/README.md).

## Plugin Development

Every plugin lives in `plugins/<name>/` and is registered in
[`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`](.claude-plugin/marketplace.json). Only `plugin.json` is
required; the rest is whatever the plugin actually ships:

```
plugins/<plugin-name>/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json     # Required: identity (name, version, description, author)
├── .lsp.json           # LSP server configuration
├── hooks/hooks.json    # Hook event wiring
├── commands/*.md       # Slash commands
├── agents/*.md         # Subagent definitions
├── skills/*/SKILL.md   # Skills
└── README.md           # Documentation
```

Directory conventions are picked up automatically — declaring `agents`, `skills` or `hooks` in
`plugin.json` is optional, and the `agents` field takes file paths rather than a directory.

Validate before committing:

```bash
claude plugin validate plugins/<name>     # a single plugin
claude plugin validate .                  # the marketplace and every entry
```
